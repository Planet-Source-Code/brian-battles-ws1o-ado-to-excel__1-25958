Allows users to select any ODBC data source, or an MS Access database, to display the tables in it, and select a table, which is automatically loaded into an Excel spreadsheet, complete with column headings (field names). Based on project submitted by Ian Mitchell:

I just changed it to use ADO instead of DAO, and DSN-Less ODBC data sources, instead of just MS Access.
